- continue testing menu recommendations for false positives, finding actual RAG results
- incorporate reading the wine menu more organically into the chat. It will give a recommendation before I can put in the menu
- decide LLM model
    - using OpenAI for now, since that is API I have access to already
    - compare different models and their price
    - OpenAI dropped model price for o-3
- enhancement: add pagination (or thumbnails?) to gallery?
    - or cap at last, say, 10 wines... but then delete older ones that can't be viewed
- mode: wine map, using leaflet
- expose K for optimal results?
- feature: stream responses on screen like how OpenAI works
- figure out why angular-cli is broken. Due to ionic somehow
- add more eslint

DONE
- don't show toast message if user closes camera
- use ion-text-area instead of textarea
- chat keyboard area is too small on mobile; buttons should be moved to line below
- for chat inquiry, should log my message as well

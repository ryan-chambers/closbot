- really need to use this a lot to see where more work is required
- determine if filtering out search results at a certain threshold of relevance, try >= 88%, would result in better performance
    - 88% could be too high for some good matches
- incorporate reading the wine menu more organically into the chat. It will give a recommendation before I can put in the menu
- RAG result accurate for chat, but not so much for reading menu
- for RAG inquiry, should log my message as well
- bug: got a false positive wine menu recommendation for Bouley/Volnay
- if I don't take a picture, no wine note is upserted. Should I upsert the note anyway?
- decide LLM model
    - using OpenAI for now, since that is API I have access to already
    - compare different models and their price
    - OpenAI dropped model price for o-3
- enhancement: add pagination (or thumbnails?) to gallery?
    - or cap at last, say, 10 wines... but then delete older ones that can't be viewed
- mode: wine map, using leaflet
- expose K for optimal results?
- feature: stream responses on screen like how OpenAI works
- figure out why angular-cli is broken. Due to ionic somehow
- add more eslint

DONE
- don't show toast message if user closes camera
- use ion-text-area instead of textarea
- chat keyboard area is too small on mobile; buttons should be moved to line below

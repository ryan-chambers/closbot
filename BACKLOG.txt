- really need to use this a lot to see where more work is required
- mobile bug: gallery, add review tabs scroll vertically
- decide LLM model
    - using OpenAI for now, since that is API I have access to already
    - compare different models and their price
    - OpenAI dropped model price for o-3
- enhancement: add pagination (or thumbnails?) to gallery?
    - or cap at last, say, 10 wines... but then delete older ones that can't be viewed
- mode: wine map, using leaflet
- is tab sufficient for showing all modes? Maybe leave off labels to have more room
- use ion-text-area instead of textarea?
- expose K for optimal results?
- filter out search results at a certain threshold of relevance?
- feature: stream responses on screen like how OpenAI works
- figure out why angular-cli is broken. Due to ionic somehow
- add more eslint

DONE
- don't show toast message if user closes camera

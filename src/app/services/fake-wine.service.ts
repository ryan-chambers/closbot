  readonly menuReco = `Response: This wine menu offers a delightful selection primarily focused on Chardonnay from Burgundy, with a strong representation of Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru and some premier cru options from Beaune.

1. **Bourgogne CÃ´te d'Or Chardonnay Options**:
   - Offers fresh and accessible Chardonnay selections ideal for those seeking bright fruit flavors with a touch of regional characteristics.

2. **Saint-Romain and Auxey-Duresses**:
   - From lesser-known appellations, these wines usually bring a good balance of minerality and fruit, with Saint-Romain generally offering more freshness and Auxey-Duresses showing a richer profile.

3. **Pernand-Vergelesses**:
   - Known for a more restrained and mineral profile, this selection from Bruno Clair will likely be lively with good acidity.

4. **Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru**:
   - High-caliber wines showcasing elegance with lemony brightness and complexity. The older vintages (e.g., 2015 and 2014) tend to provide a richer, more developed flavor profile. Producers like Bonneau du Matray and Domaine Ponsot have a reputation for making expressive and age-worthy wines.

5. **Savigny-Les-Beaune and Beaune 1er Cru**:
   - Offer a lovely expression of Pinot Noir with Savigny-Les-Beaune delivering a lighter, fresher style. The Beaune 1er Cru, especially from Joseph Drouhin, provides a more structured and complex experience with notes of red fruit and spices.

**Recommendation**: If your dinner leans towards richer dishes, the **Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru 2018 by Jean-Baptiste Boudier** could be an exceptional choice, offering complexity and a savory finish. For a lighter fare, the **Pernand-Vergelesses 2020 by Bruno Clair** offers brightness and mineral freshness, perfect for complementing more delicate dishes.`;
